# Third-year-dissertation-project
The project aims to introduce a novel solution for neural source separation by analysing the overall behaviour of firing neurons. The main features of the cortical surface were incorporated into a COMSOL model which provided an environment for signal generation and data gathering. Signal recognition was successfully achieved with a minimum distance between sources of 50µm and the probes being placed up to 2mm above the scalp. This confirmed that the oscillations of 2 and 3 sources can be distinguished with an accuracy of 99.7% and 90%, respectively.
